# Walter UI

Walter UI is a **terminal-based** user interface for managing and monitoring your Rust projects. It leverages the power of `crossterm` for terminal handling, `ratatui` for building rich terminal UIs, and `reqwest` for making HTTP requests. This project is part of the larger Walter system, which includes core functionalities provided by `walter-core`.

### 1. Splash Screen
- **Navigation**: Press `Enter` to proceed to the Dashboard.
- **Scrollbar**: Automatically initializes if user blobs are present.

### 2. Dashboard
- **Quit Application**: Press `q` to initiate quit, then `y` to confirm or `n` to cancel.
- **Navigation**: 
    - Press `1` to switch to the Dashboard screen.
    - Press `2` to switch to the Updater screen.
    - Use `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through rows.
- **Current Screen**: Displays the current screen (Dashboard or Updater).

### 3. Updater
- **Functionality**: (Commented out in the current version)
    - Intended to create a `walrus.json` file with system information.
    - Press `Enter` to execute the update process.

## Dependencies

- **crossterm**: For handling terminal I/O.
- **ratatui**: For building the terminal UI.
- **reqwest**: For making HTTP requests.
