# WalTer UI

WalTer-UI is a **terminal-based** Devtool toolchain built on Rust. It leverages the power of `crossterm` for terminal handling, `ratatui` for building rich terminal UIs, and `reqwest` for making HTTP requests. This project brings together the larger WalTer ecosystem, which includes functionalities provided by the meticulously tested and modular WalTer-Core library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

### üì¶ Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EthIndia2024IITR/walter-ui.git
    ```
2.  Install required libraries

    - For Ubuntu (use equivalents on other package managers and distributions)
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
    ```

3.  Install from Makefile:

    ```bash
    cd walter-ui
    ```

4.  Run the project:

    ```bash
    cargo build && cargo run

    ```

5.  You can access the CLI by using the --help flag

## Instructions

## CLI Options

### `--help` | `-h`

Prints the help message with usage instructions and available options.

### `--cli` | `-c`

Enables CLI mode for Walter UI.

### `--setup` | `-s`

Sets up Walter along with Walrus CLI, Walrus Site Builder, and Sui Client.

### `--update` | `-u`

Updates Walter and its dependencies.

### `--sqlite` | `-sql`

Runs the Walrus SQLite shell with rollbacks. Requires `blobID` as an argument.

### `--build-site` | `-bs`

Builds a site using the Walrus Site Builder. A path is required as an argument.

### `--run-pinner` | `-rp`

Runs the Walrus HTTP Pinning service in the background.

### 1. Splash Screen

- `Enter` key to get into the dashboard and use the arrow keys to navigate here. Use the number keys to navigate between screens and check for instructions on the bottom part of the screen.

### 2. Dashboard

- Contains descriptive System and Blob Information
- Users can view the expiry epoch of their blobs
- Shows all blobs associated with a users `sui` account

### 3. Uploader

- Can be used to upload individual files

### 4. Migrate from IPFS

- **Users can migrate their existing filesystem completely from IPFS to Walrus.**

### 5. Sharding with Encryption and Epoch Extension

- Users can send their large databases to Walrus by breaking them into 13.3 GB chunks (which is the max size that Walrus supports).
- Also supports encryption.

- **Quit Application**: Press `q` to initiate quit, then `y` to confirm or `n` to cancel.
- **Navigation**:
  - Use the footer to see all the navigation information.
